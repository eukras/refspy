                <p><b>REFSPY</b>. <i>A Python library for working with biblical
                references in ordinary text.</i></p>
                <p>In the demonstration text below, references are highlighted in <span
                class="green">green</span>, and identified in superscript<sup>Like
                This</sup>. Book names which aren't themselves references but provide
                context are highlighted in <span class="yellow">yellow</span>.
                Malformed references are highlighted in <span
                class="purple">purple</span>.</p>
                <blockquote><pre>Human-written Bible references look like Rom 12.1-2, 9-12, 2 Cor. 4:16-5:5,
or Philemon 4-7. They wrap lines, use spaces inconsistently, use colons and
periods interchangeably, indicate abbreviations with periods (or not), and
have commas both between and within references. They are sometimes
malformed, like Mt 1.10000 or 1:3-2, but might also use number
abbreviations like Ps 119:122-24. They might refer to Deuterocanonical
books (DC), like Wis 7:21-30 or 2 Macc 7, or Anagignoskomena (DCO), like 1
Esdras 4:35-40. A book name, like Second Corinthians, may provide context
for references that follow, such as 5:11-15 or vv.16-21. We want to match,
say, 'John' but not match 'John Smith' in these cases. If we cite Romans
(but then add a reference to 2ndCo 5:11-21 in parentheses), a subsequent
reference like 12:9-21 should still be to Romans. Using letters for partial
verses, as in II Cor 5:10a-15d, has no consistent meaning, so the letters
are ignored. Book aliases that are common words will be ignored except in
references, e.g. Am 4:1, but not Am.</pre></blockquote>

                <p>Refspy will sort and collate references into an index; combine
                overlapping and adjacent references into a summary; list the
                busiest chapters as 'hotspots'; and add links to any of these.</p>

                <p> Because a number or a range ('1' or '2-3') could refer to either
                verses or chapters, or other regular numbers having nothing to do with
                biblical referencing ('ch.8'), we only match references that are
                preceded by a book name, a chapter number and colon ('4:'), or a verse
                marker ('v.', 'vv.').</p>
