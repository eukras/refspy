Human-written Bible references look like Rom 12.1, 6-17, 2 Cor. 1:2-3:4, or
Philemon 2-3. They wrap lines, use spaces inconsistently, use colons and
periods interchangeably, indicate abbreviations with periods (or not), and have
commas both between and within references. They are sometimes malformed, like Mt
1.10000 or 1:3-2, but might also use number abbreviations like Ps 119:122-24. A
book name, such as the Second Letter to the Corinthians, provides context for
references that follow, such as 5:21 or vv.25,37-38. If we cite Romans (but
then add a reference to 2ndCo 3:5-8 in parentheses), a subsequent reference
like 12:16 will still be to Romans. Using letters for partial verses, as in II
Cor 5:30a-40d, has no consistent meaning, so the letters are ignored. Book
aliases that are common words will be ignored except in references, e.g. Am
3:1, but not Am.
