        <p><b>REFSPY</b>. <i>A Python library for working with biblical
        references in ordinary text.</i></p>
        <p>In the demonstration text below, references are highlighted in <span
        class="green">green</span>, and identified in superscript<sup>Like
        This</sup>. Book names which aren't themselves references but provide
        context are highlighted in <span class="yellow">yellow</span>.
        Malformed references are highlighted in <span
        class="purple">purple</span>.</p>
        <blockquote><pre>
Human-written Bible references look like Rom 12.1, 6-17, 2 Cor. 1:2-3:4, or
Philemon 2-3. They wrap lines, use spaces inconsistently, use colons and
periods interchangeably, indicate abbreviations with periods (or not), and have
commas both between and within references. They are sometimes malformed, like Mt
1.10000 or 1:3-2, but might also use number abbreviations like Ps 119:122-24. A
book name, such as Second Corinthians, provides context for references that
follow, such as 5:21 or vv.25,37-38. If we cite Romans (but then add a
reference to 2ndCo 3:5-8 in parentheses), a subsequent reference like 12:16
will still be to Romans. Using letters for partial verses, as in II Cor
5:30a-40d, has no consistent meaning, so the letters are ignored. Book 
aliases that are common words will be ignored except in references, e.g. Am
3:1, but not Am.

        <p>Refspy will sort and collate references into an index; combine
        overlapping and adjacent references into a summary; list the 
        busiest chapters as 'hotspots'; and add links to any of these.</p>
        <ul>

        <p> Because a number or a range ('1' or '2-3') could refer to either
        verses or chapters, or other regular numbers having nothing to do with
        biblical referencing ('ch.8'), we only match references that are
        preceded by a book name, a chapter number and colon ('4:'), or a verse
        marker ('v.', 'vv.').</p>
