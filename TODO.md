# To Do List

## Next

- Test against human writing styles (use Article Wiki as a live demo and playground); expand test suites to reflect special cases.
- Collect a gallery of difficult source texts.
- Deut. references (RB issue report)

## Possibilities

- Make spaces between name and number references optional (e.g. `Gen3`; requires alpha-to-numeric regex boundary).
- Generate a hash from a list of references, to quickly confirm that the list is unchanged, or the same as another list.

## More remote possibilities

- Other corpuses (Septuagint, Apostolic Father, ANF)?
- Special cases like 'zero verses' in LXX Psalms, etc?
