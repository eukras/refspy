# To Do List

## Next 

* Try excluding ambiguous_aliases ONLY from book references. 
* Test against human writing styles (use Article Wiki as a live demo and playground); expand test suites to reflect special cases. 
* Collect a gallery of difficult source texts.


## Possibilities

* Make spaces between name and number references optional (e.g. `Gen3`; requires alpha-to-numeric regex boundary).


## More remote possibilities 

* Other corpuses (Septuagint, Apostolic Father, ANF)?
* Special cases like 'zero verses' in LXX Psalms, etc?
