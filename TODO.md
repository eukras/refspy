# To Do List

## Next 

* Test against human writing styles (use Article Wiki as a live demo and playground); expand test suites to reflect special cases. 
* Collect a gallery of difficult source texts.
* Deut references (RB issue report)


## Possibilities

* Make spaces between name and number references optional (e.g. `Gen3`; requires alpha-to-numeric regex boundary).
* Generate a hash from a list of references, to quickly confirm that the list is unchanged, or the same as another list. 


## More remote possibilities 

* Other corpuses (Septuagint, Apostolic Father, ANF)?
* Special cases like 'zero verses' in LXX Psalms, etc?
